# DLAI-MultimodalDixitBot

This repository hosts the final project material for the course Deep Learning and Applied Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to implement a bot capable to play the board game Dixit, combining LLMs to understand and describe images. The main challenge of this game is that it is very imaginative.

The Dixit cards used are downloaded from https://github.com/jminuscula/dixit-online/tree/master/cards.
