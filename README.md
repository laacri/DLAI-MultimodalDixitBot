# DLAI-MultimodalDixitBot

This repository hosts the final project materials for the course Deep Learning and Applied Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to implement an agent capable to play the board game "Dixit", from both the perspectives of the storyteller and the guesser, combining a CLIP-like model and LLMs to describe and understand images. The peculiar challenge presented by this project is that "Dixit" is a very imaginative game.<br>
The Dixit cards used are downloaded from https://github.com/jminuscula/dixit-online/tree/master/cards. <br>
