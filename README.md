# DLAI-MultimodalDixitBot

This repository hosts the final project material for the course Deep Learning and Applied Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to implement a bot capable to play the board game Dixit from both the perspectives of the storyteller and the guesser, combining a CLIP-like model and LLMs to describe and understand images.

One of the main challenges of this game is that it is very imaginative.

The Dixit cards used are downloaded from https://github.com/jminuscula/dixit-online/tree/master/cards.
